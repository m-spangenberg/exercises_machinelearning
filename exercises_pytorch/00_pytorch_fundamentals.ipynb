Even though most references in PyTorch are to just '[tensors](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html)', there exists various kinds of tensors. All a tensor is in this context is \"a multi-dimensional matrix containing elements of a single data type\". We instantiate tensors using `torch.Tensor`."
